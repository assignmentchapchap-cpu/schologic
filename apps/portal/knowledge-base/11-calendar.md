## Using Calendar for Planning

### What You Can See

- All upcoming deadlines at a glance
- Busy periods with multiple assignments
- Gaps between assignments
- End-of-semester clustering

### Planning Tips

1. **Spread Due Dates**: Avoid clustering too many on same day
2. **Check Weekends**: Students prefer weekday deadlines
3. **Consider Other Classes**: Students have multiple commitments
4. **Buffer Before Exams**: Reduce assignments near exam periods

## Student Calendar

Students have their own calendar view showing:
- Assignments from all enrolled classes
- Their personal deadlines
- Color-coded by class

This helps students manage their workload across multiple courses.
